```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load tinytex, include = FALSE}
library(tinytex)
#update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
#tinytex::tlmgr_update()
#tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()
#tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

This R markdown file documents my first attempts at using git and github for version control on an RStudio project. I'll be modifying this report, staging and committing changes and then pushing to github.

Below is a test plot of ditance (miles) and speed (mph):

```{r, test plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed(mph)", ylab = "distance(miles)")

```


A summary of the df is given below

```{r, cars summary}

library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))

```
